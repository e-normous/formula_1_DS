Data Science with Formula 1 data from Kaggle (see https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)


In this repo, we'll go through some basic data science concepts. We will be discovering the data mentioned above and try to work on different aspects over time. If you have an idea we have not implemented yet, please come up with it :-) 

Mainly, we'll be focusing on the following libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
